# 2nd commit : 
 - tried to approach problem statement sequentially first 
 - stored(O/P) particle positions in file named "particle_positions.txt"

  To run sequential code : 
  1. clone the repository by "git clone 'repo link'"
  2. change working directory( "cd desktop") to the path we cloned our github project.
  3. compile the code by using "g++ filename.cpp(FDS_sequential.cpp) -o filename(FDS_sequential)"
  4. to run code "./FDS_sequential"
